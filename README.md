# celery weather app
## Motivation

*Sigh*... Yes, another weather app. My primary motivation for this project was to get familiar with vanilla JS before moving on to React. I learned a ton, including: 

* **Firebase** - Realtime databases, user authentification
* **API calls** - HTTP requests, Postman, async await
* **Refactoring** - Modules, file structure
* **Git branches** - The true utility of git branches. When you have something that works, don't mess it up.
* **Environment variables** - Things like the OpenWeatherMap API key needed to be stored in a .env file and configured in Netlify
