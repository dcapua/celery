# celery weather app
## Motivation

*Sigh*... Yes, another weather app for retrieving current weather conditions via OpenWeatherMap APIs. However, there is also a "memories" feature which allows the user to save the current location/conditions and a note to their own personal database. 

My primary motivation for this project was to get more familiar with vanilla JS, Bootstrap, and Firebase/Firestore. I learned a ton, including: 

* **Firebase** - Firestore noSQL database, user authentification (using GoogleAuthProvider), queries
* **API calls** - HTTP requests, Postman, async await (JS)
* **Refactoring** - Modules, file structure
* **Git branches** - The true utility of git branches. When you have something that works, don't mess it up.
* **Environment variables** - Sensitive items like the OpenWeatherMap API key need to be stored in a .env file and configured in Netlify.
* **Bootstrap** - I didn't want to spend a ton of time on styling for this project and Bootstrap came in handy, especially the grid system.
